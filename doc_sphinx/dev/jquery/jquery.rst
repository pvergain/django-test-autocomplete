    I don't use it by default anymore, but it also depends on the project and the browsers 
    I have to support. These days I don't have to support IE8 anymore, but I'm 
    still maintaining some code bases developed a couple of years ago that needed 
    to support IE8. So, I still see jQuery around from time to time.
    
    I think we can all agree that jQuery is not the tool for building SPAs, but 
    to be honest, it was never conceived for that.

    Exactly. I still find jQuery to provide the exact mix of functionality I 
    need for little sites like that. 
    I would probably not, however, use jQuery if I were starting on a large complex 
    app nowadays. I think modern frameworks like Angular 2 just provide better 
    paradigms for building apps at that scale.
