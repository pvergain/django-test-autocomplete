   AJAX
       Ajax (also AJAX; /ˈeɪdʒæks/; short for asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
       is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on 
       the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. 
       With Ajax, web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server 
       asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display 
       and behavior of the existing page. 
       By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, 
       Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change 
       content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. 
       
       In practice, modern implementations commonly substitute JSON for XML 
       due to the advantages of being native to JavaScript.

   JSON
       JSON (canonically pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/ JAY-sən;[1] sometimes JavaScript 
       Object Notation) is an open-standard format that uses human-readable text 
       to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. 
       It is the most common data format used for asynchronous browser/server 
       communication, largely replacing XML which is used by AJAX.

       JSON is a language-independent data format. It derives from JavaScript, 
       but as of 2016, code to generate and parse JSON-format data is available 
       in many programming languages. The official Internet media type for JSON 
       is application/json. The JSON filename extension is .json.

       Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format; two competing 
       standards, RFC 7159 and ECMA-404, define it. The ECMA standard describes 
       only the allowed syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and 
       security considerations.
